# label-counter
CRUD labels sorted by frequency of occurrence.

## Use Case:
- A user wants to keep track the # of occurrance of keywords (we'll call them labels) as they are encountered. Build a user interface that empowers them to do this.

## Requirements
- Display a list of labels that is sorted by most to least # of occurences.
- Creating a Label:
  - If the label does not yet exist, add it to the list with a count of 1.
  - If the label already exists, increment the count by 1.
- A label's count can be increased or decreased, UI/UX for this behavior is up to developer disgression.
- If a label's count fall
- A label can be deleted entirely, UI/UX for this behavior is up to developer's disgression.

## Bonus
- Style the list.
- Autosuggestion when inputing if the list already exists.
- Light mode/dark mode.
- Ability to filter the list.


### Other notes:
- feel free to use any technology even generative AI, but be prepared to answer questions (such as pros, cons, considerations, etc) that went into your choice as it relates to web development.
